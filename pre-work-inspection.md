# Pre work inspection

**1. PRE-WORK INSPECTION**

Open doors and windows for 30 minutes before working in the home to reduce odor levels and allow for dilution of airborne contaminants.

**1.1 Basic Safety Inspection**  
**Is there structural damage?**

* If YES do not enter the home until a professional has inspected it and determined it is safe.

**Has your electrical system been inspected?**

* If NO have your electrician or KSEB inspect your service before using it. Make sure the main electrical switch is turned off. DO NOT enter an area of the home that has standing water until the power has been shut off.
* If YES, but is not rated safe, DO NOT use the system. Plan on renting or buying a generator for clean-up work. Do not use open flames for lighting or heat.

**Has the natural gas system been inspected?**

* **I**f NO have the supply company inspect your service \(cylinder, pipe\) before using it. Make sure the gas line entering the home is turned off.

**Do you smell natural gas?**

* If YES, call your supply company or distributor or police for help immediately.

**Are water pipes, faucets, sinks and tubs free of holes, cracks or leaks?**

* If NO, turn off the water that leads to the pipe/damage. Plan on having a plumber repair the damage. Lot of free volunteer services are now available.
* If YES, do not drink or use water for cooking or washing food or bathing until the water utility or public health department says that it is safe to use.

**Is there standing water in the home?**

* If YES, decides if the water needs to be pumped out or can be mopped out. Plan to rent or buy a pump if needed. Wear boots before entering water.

**Can the flood contamination be limited to certain rooms? For example, did the second floor have no water damage and no signs of mold?**

* If YES, it may be possible to cut off areas for use for storage. See Site Preparation for how to section off parts of the home.

**Was the home built before 1978?**

If yes you should assume that it has lead-based paint and should use lead safe work practices when disturbing the paint \(See HUD LeadPaintSafetyFieldGuide: : [http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead/training/LBPguide.pdf](http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead/training/LBPguide.pdf)

**Are there 8” x 8” or 9” x 9” floor tiles in the home? Is there any known asbestos in the home?**

* If YES, you should assume rigid floor tiles measuring 8”x 8” or 9”x 9” made before 1970 contain asbestos. Asbestos can cause cancer and other diseases. Spray the tiles with water and then carefully remove. You may also need the help of an asbestos specialist to remove these materi- als, especially if the asbestos is nonrigid \(easily crumbled\).

**Is there damage to doors, trim, windows? Is there damage to cabinets and cabinet doors? Were the large appliances flooded?**

* All of these components can be saved if not replace, think about how much they are now worth and how much it will cost to restore compared to your costs to replace them. If you do not think you can remove all mold and other contaminants from building components and appliances, replacement is a better option. Do not try to preserve pressboard cabinets or hollow-core doors that have mold growth. When appliances are flooded, they can rarely be saved.

**Are the toilets and sewer pipes free of holes, cracks or leaks? Do they drain well?**

* If NO, do not use plumbing until the plumber has fixed the plumbing

**Was the heating and air conditioning system flooded or are there signs of mold?**

* If YES, then do not use system until a AC professional can inspect and either clean the system or replace it. Again ther are several volunteers on call.

**1.2 Flood/Storm Damage Inspection**

**Is there an active roof leak or other damage to the house that would let water in?**

IF YES, cover the roof or other damages area with a tarpaulin until it can be fixed. There must be a temporary water- and wind-tight roof before beginning storm damage repair.

**Contact your insurance company immediately, but do not wait for the claims adjuster to come to the home before removing wet and moldy materials. Take photographs for insurance purposes.**

Assume that building interiors are seriously contaminated with mold if:

* If the building was wet or under water for more than 48 hours. 
* You see more mold growth than what was present before the flood.
* You see signs of water damage or mold or smell strong mold or mildew odo

**Can any of the furnishings and belongings in the home be saved?**

* In general, do not try to save moldy, porous things \(items that absorb water\).
* The following itesm need to be thrown away when you can see or smell mold and/or the materials have been under water:
* Carpet and carpet paddings
* Upholstered furniture
* Computers, microwaves, window A/C units, and other electronics/appliances that had fans and were housed in moldy rooms.
* Papers and books
* Food Items, including canned or tinned food that were in contact with flood waters.

**Items that can be typically saved include:**

* Non-porous items like china, glass, jewelry, porcelain and metal
* All wood furniture with mold-growth but otherwise in good condition
* Some electronic and small appliances \(depends on flooding conditions\)
* Photographs, books and  valuable and important legal documents with minor levels of mold growth
* Artwork, textiles, clothing that are not physically damaged.

If you plan to save your belongings think about how much storage space you will need. If they cannot be stored at home, make plans for moving and storage at another location. Clean all personal belongings from mold-contaminated areas before moving them to storage areas.  
When deciding whether to save items, remember that it will take a lot of cleaning time to remove mold and flood contamination to make them safe for reuse. For many items without sentimental value, replacement may be better. This is especially true if items are covered by insurance.

**1.3 Air out building**

**Before leaving the building after the inspection:**

* Open windows as long as the weather is dry.
* Open all the windows on the lower floor that you can safely keep open. Some windows may be able to be left partially open. For safety, fix these openings by putting a screw in the window frame.
* Open interior doors, especially closets and interior rooms, to let air reach all areas of the building. Take interior doors off their hinges if necessary to help the air flow.
* Open the attic windows or skylights, if available, to increase ventilation.
* DO NOT run the central air system if you have one.
* If power is on, put a fan in a window to blow air to the outdoors. DO NOT use fans if the house is contaminated with sewage because the air movement may spread germs into other parts of the house.
